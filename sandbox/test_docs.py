"""
Module containing a class, global function, exception, type variable and type alias.

The type variable gets included in the list of variables captured by the template and so is
automatically summarised and documented.

For some reason, the type alias doesn't. However, it can be documented manually using
the `autodata` directive, ie::

    .. autodata:: myTypeAlias

.. autodata:: myTypeAlias
